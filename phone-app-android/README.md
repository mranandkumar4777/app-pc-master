# Presenter Remote — Android app

A small native app that connects your phone to Presenter running on your computer.
It shows the same remote as the web page, plus: it remembers the computer's address,
keeps the screen awake, and the **volume keys** work as Prev / Next.

## Build the APK (one time, on your computer)
1. Install Android Studio (free): https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **File → Open** and pick this `phone-app-android` folder. Let it sync
   (it may offer to install Android SDK 34 — accept).
3. **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**.
4. When it finishes, click **locate**. The file is `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
5. Send that file to your phone (USB, email, Drive) and open it. Android will ask you to
   allow installing from that source — allow it. Or plug the phone in with USB debugging on
   and press the green **Run** button instead.

## Use it
1. On the computer, start Presenter (Presenter.bat / .app / presenter.sh) and click **📱 Phone**.
2. Phone on the same Wi-Fi. Either scan the QR code with the camera and choose
   **Presenter Remote**, or open the app and type the address (e.g. `192.168.1.23`).
3. Enter the PIN once. After that it just opens and connects.
- **Back button** on the remote = change computer/address.
- Scanning the QR only offers this app when Presenter uses the default port 8787; with another
  port, type the address into the app.

## Updates & Settings
Tap **⚙** in the top-right corner of the remote screen for Settings: shows the installed
version and has a **Check for updates** button (the app also checks once on its own at
launch). New versions show a dismissible notice with an Update button and a ✕ Later button.
See **DISTRIBUTION-AND-UPDATES.md** (one level up in the full project, or alongside this file
in the standalone repo) for one-time setup and how distributing this to other people works.

Release builds (what the GitHub Action publishes) are now shrunk and obfuscated via R8, still
signed with the same fixed key as before so updates keep installing over the previous version.
